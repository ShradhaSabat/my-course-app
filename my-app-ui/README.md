# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

It puts .js and .css files in the build/static/js and build/static/css directories, respectively. Let’s break down the code pictured above:
1. Main.[hash].chunk.css represents all the CSS codes our application needs. Note that even if you write CSS in JavaScript using something like styled-components, it would still compile to CSS
2. Number.[hash].chunk.js represents all the libraries used in our application. It’s essentially all the vendor codes imported from the node_modules folder
3. Main.[hash].chunk.js is all of our application files - all the code we wrote for our React application
4. Runtime-main.[hash].js represents a small webpack runtime logic used to load and run our application

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Code Splitting

Because main.[hash].chunk.js size increases as our application grows, larger apps can exceed 1000KB in size, meaning that there can be a dramatic increase in our app load time.
Say, main.[hash].chunk.js is 1000KB in size. Consequently, if the login page is 2KB, a user would have to load a 1000KB chunk to view a 2KB page. To implement code splitting:
1. Dynamic imports
2. React.lazy()
3. React.Suspense()
4. react-router

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

npm i source-map-explorer
Then in package.json, add the following line to scripts:

   "scripts": {
+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test"
     }
npm run build
npm run analyze
